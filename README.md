This repo is a collection of Android project examples including Jetpack Compose, UI patterns like MVVM, etc. 

In my Software Systems Engineering class years ago, my favorite teacher Paul Nguyen managed to teach us a lot of new technologies in a single semester. Whenever he introduced a new technology or a new concept, he would pull up a folder full of mini examples. Each example would focus on a single topic. Waling through the examples, running the code, making small adjustment give us a much better understanding of those new technologies and abstract concepts like CAP theorem. 

I want to continue learning through this approach.

WIP: All examples will be moved into the AndroidExamples folder for app modularization.
